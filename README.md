Communal Spotify queue management, revisited.

## What is it?

At its core, fireplace is a simple song queue app. Users simply search and push songs to a communal queue. A designated player logs in to his Spotify account through the app and can manage simple playback. 

Playback is controlled entirely by the back-end so the app works in the background for the most part (bar pausing/skipping songs, removing or adding from the queue and so on), which can be done from the client's side.

Songs played from the queue are able to be created into a Spotify playlist at any point, creating a record of that specific queue.

## Why is it?

Most of my best memories come from being with friends and playing music together.

It can be a hassle to constantly have to go to someones phone to find a song or get them to play something for you. Fireplace lets the process be as easy as possible.

Best of all, it lets you save all of the songs played as a Spotify playlist, creating a permanent memory of that event, trip or occasion. 

## How is it?
Its good!

## Will it support multiple users?

Not at the moment, I mainly created this to use amongst my friends. If it becomes popular enough that they want to use it in their own time, I'll consider adding user support.
